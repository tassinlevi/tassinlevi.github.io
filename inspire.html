        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Dave Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana. Afterwards, he formed the Foo Fighters and blessed us. He was seen as the good guy of rock until he got someone that was not his wife pregnant. .</p>
